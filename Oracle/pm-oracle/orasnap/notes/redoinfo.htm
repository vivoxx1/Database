<B>Redo Log Status:</B><BR>
<LI><B>UNUSED</B> -  Indicates the online redo log has never been written to. This is the state of a redo log that was just added, or just after a RESETLOGS, when it is not the current redo log.

<LI>You may also need to perform a manual checkpoint on the database.  This is accomplished through the ALTER SYSTEM CHECKPOINT command:
