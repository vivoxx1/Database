<LI>Synonyms are a database's shorthand. Synonyms allow long complex combinations of schema, object name and connection strings to be reduced to a simple alias. Synonyms remove the requirement to prefix a table, view or sequence with a schema name, thus performing a simple form of data hiding by allowing tables from one or more schemas to appear to be located in the users own schema.
