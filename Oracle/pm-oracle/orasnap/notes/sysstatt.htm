<LI>This query provides information on the full table scan activity.  If your application is OLTP only, having long full
table scans can be an indicator of having missing or incorrect indexes or untuned SQL.
<LI><B>Table fetch by rowid</B> reflect the cumulative number of rows fetched from tables using a TABLE ACCESS BY ROWID
operation.
<LI><B>Table fetch continued row</B> reflect the cumulative number of continued rows fetched.  This value is incremented
when accessing a row that is longer than a block in length and when accessing &quot;migrated&quot; rows.  Migrated rows are
rows that were relocated from their original location to a new location because of an <B>update</B> that increased their
size to the point where they could no longer be accommodated inside their original block.  Access to migrated rows will
cause this statistic's value to increment only if the access is performed by ROWID.  Full table scans of tables that
contain migrated rows do not cause this counter to increment.
<LI><B>Table scan blocks gotten</B> reflect the cumulative number of blocks read for full table scans.
<LI><B>Table scans rows gotten</B> reflect the cumulative number of rows read for full table scans.
<LI><B>Table scans (cache partitions)</B> is used with the Parallel Query Option.  The number of RowID ranges corresponds
to the number of simultaneous query server processes that scan the table.
<LI><B>Table scans (long scans/long tables)</B> indicate a full scan of a table that has &gt; 5 database blocks.
<LI><B>Table scans (rowid ranges)</B> is used with the Parallel Query Option.  The number of RowID ranges corresponds
to the number of simultaneous query server processes that scan the table.
<LI><B>Table scans (short scans/short tables)</B> indicate a full scan of a table that has &lt;= 5 database blocks.
