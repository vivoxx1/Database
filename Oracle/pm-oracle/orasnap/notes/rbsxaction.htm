<LI>The name of the <B>consistent changes</B> statistic is misleading.  It does not indicate the number of updates 
(or changes), but rather, the number of times a consistent get had to retrieve and &quot;old&quot; version of a block
because of updates that occurred after the cursor had been opened.  As of Oracle7.3, a more accurate statistic was added.
Named <B>data blocks consistent reads - undo records applied</B>; the new statistic gives the actual number of data 
records applied.
<LI>The <B>consistent gets</B> statistic reflects the number of accesses made to the block buffer to retrieve data in a 
consistent mode.  Most accesses to the buffer are done with the consistent get mechanism, which uses the SCN 
(System Change Number) to make sure the data being read has not changed since the query was started.
<LI>The <B>data blocks consistent reads - undo records applied</B> statistic reflects the number of updates (or changes)
applied.
