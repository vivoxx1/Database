<LI><B>Parameter</B> - Name of the undocumented parameter
<LI><B>Value</B> - Current value for the parameter
<LI><B>Desc</B> - Brief description of parameter
<P>
<LI>_ALLOW_RESETLOGS_CORRUPTION - This saves you when you have corrupted redo logs
<LI>_CORRUPTED_ROLLBACK_SEGMENTS - This saves you when you have corrupted RB segments
<LI>_SPIN_COUNT - This shows how often the processor will take a new request (reduce CPU timeouts)
<LI>_LOG_ENTRY_PREBUILD_THRESHOLD - Redo entries larger than this will be prebuilt
<LI>_LATCH_SPIN_COUNT - This shows how often a latch request will be taken (reduce latch timeouts)
<LI>_DB_BLOCK_WRITE_BATCH - Number of blocks to group in each DB Writer I/O
<LI>_CPU_COUNT - Number of CPUs that you have (causes bugs with Parallel Query option).  Check with Oracle support for restrictions on some versions and O/S
<LI>_INIT_SQL_FILE - Where the sql.bsq file is located
<LI>_TRACE_FILES_PUBLIC - This allows users to see the TRACE output without major privileges
<LI>_FAST_FULL_SCAN_ENABLED - This allow indexed fast full scans if only indexes are needed
<LI>_CORRUPT_BLOCKS_ON_STUCK_RECOVERY - This sometimes gets a corrupted database up.
<LI>_ALWAYS_STAR_TRANSFORMATION - This is a fast method for Data Warehouse if you have a good designer.
<LI>_SMALL_TABLE_THRESHOLD - Small tables are pinned into memory if smaller than this
