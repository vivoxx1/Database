<P>
<LI>Views are virtual looks at tables. They don't exist until queried except as a specification statement stored in the database. 
<LI>A single view can be very efficient, but the "stacking" of views, that is, views that reference views that reference views, can show a performance problem. 
<LI>If you attempt to create a view using grants received from a role you will get an ORA-01933 error. You must have direct grants on all objects used in the view definition.
