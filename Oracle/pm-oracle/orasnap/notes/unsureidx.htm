<B>TABLES WITH QUESTIONABLE INDEX(ES) NOTES:</B><BR>
<LI><B>Owner</B> - Owner of the table
<LI><B>Table Name</B> - Name of the table
<LI><B>Column</B> - Name of the column in question
<P>
<LI> The above query shows all tables that have more than one index with the same leading column.
These indexes can cause queries to use an inappropriate indexes; in other words, Oracle will use the index that
was created most recently if two indexes are of equal ranking.  This can cause different indexes to be used
from one environment to the next (e.g., from DEV to QA to PROD).
<LI> The information does not automatically indicate that an index is incorrect; however, you may need to
justify the existence of each of the indexes above.
