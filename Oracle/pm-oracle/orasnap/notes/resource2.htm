<LI><B>Username</B> - Name of the user

<LI><B>SQL Text</B> - Text of the SQL statement requiring the cursor, or the PL/SQL anonymous code
<P>
<LI>This report identified the current activity in your system and highlights if and when cursors are not being closed properly.  If a user is identified from this statement with a large number of open cursors, it may signify that an application module or modules are not closing cursors when complete.  As a general rule, cursors should be closed when they are no longer needed to eliminate system overhead (this is often times a common PL/SQL coding area overlooked).
