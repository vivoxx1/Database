<B>WAIT STATISTIC NOTES:</B><BR>
<LI><B>Class</B> - Class of block subject to contention 
<LI><B>Count</B> - Number of waits by this OPERATION for this CLASS of block 
<LI><B>Time</B> -Sum of all wait times for all the waits by this OPERATION for this CLASS of block  
<P>
<LI><B>Data Blocks</B> - Usually occurs when there are too many modified blocks in the buffer cache; reduce contention
by adding DBWR processes.
<LI><B>Free List</B> - May occur if multiple data loading programs run simultaneously.
<LI><B>Segment Header</B> - May occur when may full table scans execute simultaneously with data loading processes;
aggravated by the parallel options.  Reschedule data loading jobs to reduce contention;
<LI><B>Sort Block</B> - Rarely seen except when the Parallel Query option is used; reduce contention by reducing
the degree of parallelism or decreasing the SORT_AREA_SIZE init.ora parameter setting.
<LI><B>Undo Block</B> - Very rarely occurs; may be caused by multiple users updating records in the same data block at
a very fast rate; contention can usually be resolved by increasing the PCTFREE of the tables being modified.
<LI><B>Undo Header</B> - May occur if there are not enough rollback segments to support the number of concurrent 
transactions.
