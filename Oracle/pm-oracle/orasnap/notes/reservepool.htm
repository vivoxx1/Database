<P>
<LI><B>shared_pool_reserved_size</B> - Controls the amount of SHARED_POOL_SIZE reserved for large allocations. The fixed view V$SHARED_POOL_RESERVED helps you tune these parameters. Begin this tuning only after performing all other shared pool tuning on the system.  
 
<LI><B>shared_pool_reserved_min_alloc</B> - Controls allocation for the reserved memory. To create a reserved list, SHARED_POOL_RESERVED_SIZE must be greater than SHARED_POOL_RESERVED_MIN_ALLOC. Only allocations larger than SHARED_POOL_RESERVED_POOL_MIN_ALLOC can allocate space from the reserved list if a chunk of memory of sufficient size is not found on the shared pool's free lists. The default value of SHARED_POOL_RESERVED_MIN_ALLOC should be adequate for most systems.
