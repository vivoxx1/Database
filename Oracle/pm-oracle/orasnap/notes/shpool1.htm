<B>LIBRARY CACHE STATISTIC NOTES:</B><BR>
<LI><B>Namespace</B> - Library cache namespace (SQL AREA, TABLE/PROCEDURE, BODY, TRIGGER, INDEX, CLUSTER, OBJECT, PIPE)
<LI><B>Gets</B> - Number of times the system requests handles to library objects belonging to this namespace
<LI><B>GetHits</B> - Number of times the handles are already allocated in the cache.
If the handle is not already allocated, it is a miss.  The handle is then allocated and inserted into the cache.
<LI><B>GetHit Ratio</B> - Number of GETHITS divided by GETS.  Values close to 1 indicate that most of the handles the system
has tried to get are cached.
<LI><B>Pins</B> - Number of times the system issues pin requests for objects in the cache in order to access them.
<LI><B>PinHits</B> - Number of times that objects the system is pinning and accessing are already allocated and
initialized in the cache.  Otherwise, it is a miss, and the system has to allocate it in the cache and initialize it with
data queried from the database or generate the data.
<LI><B>PinHit Ratio</B> - Number of PINHITS divided by number of PINS.  Values close to 1 indicate that most of the objects
the system has tried to pin and access have been cached.
<LI><B>Reloads</B> - Number of times that library objects have to be reinitialized and reloaded with data because
they have been aged out or invalidated.
<LI><B>Invalidations</B> - Number of times that non-persistent library objects (like shared SQL areas) have been invalidated.
<P>
<LI>GetHit Ratio and PinHit Ratio should be &gt; 70
