<B>TABLES EXPERIENCING CHAINING NOTES:</B><BR>
<LI><B>Owner Name</B> - Owner of the table

<P>
<LI> Chaining can occur when there is not enough room in the data blocks to
store changes.  A chained record is one that exists in multiple blocks instead
of a single block.  Accessing multiple blocks for the same record can be costly in terms of
performance.
<LI> To avoid chaining, set PCTFREE (amount of space reserved in a block for
updates) correctly.  This parameter is set when the table is created.  The
default value is set to 10 (10 percent free for updates) but this needs to
be much higher in a table where there is a large frequency of update activity.
