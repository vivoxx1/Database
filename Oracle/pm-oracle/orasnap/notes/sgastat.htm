<P>
<LI>The &quot;free memory&quot; value is an indicator of the free contiguous memory in the shared pool.  If this value is constantly low or is reduced in a short period of time after database startup, it is a good indicator that your shared pool should be increased.  In the case where free memory is low, a stored package or procedure may result in an error, since there may not be enough contiguous memory to load the object into the shared pool.
